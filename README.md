# Instructions

Hi Professor, my main file containing the kotlin code is MainActivity.kt and the xml file for the UI is activity_main.xml. I have used themes.xml to add colors and to enhance the UI. I have used pixel 6 API 31 as my emulator with Android version 12 

Also, Thank you so much professor for such an effective assignment, I have learned a lot.
